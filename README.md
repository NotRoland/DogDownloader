# Dog Downloader
This is the first project I've made by myself in Go. I'm trying to learn how to use Git as well, so I'm posting it here.
### What does it do?
It downloads dog pictures from the dog.ceo API asynchronously using goroutines. The pictures are saved in the "Dogs" directory.
### How do I use it?
Assuming you have Go installed, just download this repo and execute "go run main.go". I've made a small CLI interface for it.
